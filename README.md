# SketchOS
SketchOS is a graphical operating system for OpenComputers.

## 1. OS Features

### 1.1 The EFI
SketchOS can use an EFI bootloader. Basically, this is a regular bootloader
that (can) load code from the OS before booting.

### 1.2 Graphics
SketchOS, as stated, is graphical. It can, however, be run in many environments
because it can boot as a shell among other things.

### 1.3 APIs
SketchOS uses a powerful API system that is more effective than most.
For example, the `render` module. `render` provides safe, high-precision
graphics that will never crash.
